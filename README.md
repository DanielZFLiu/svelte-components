# Description
Reusable svelte components anyone can use. 

## Motivation
I have accumulated a stack of components through involvement with other projects. This repository aims to collect these components and transform them to be as reusable as possible. Specifically, I aim to focus on 2 aspects:
1. customizable components that works out of the box 
2. readable and extendable code

## Current Schedule
For now, I plan to update the repo every week with new components. Stay tuned.
